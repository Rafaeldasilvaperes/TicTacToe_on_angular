# ⁣⭕ Tic Tac Toe ❌

A simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using Angular and as a PWA (Progressive Web App) and deployed in the Firebase Host. This project was based on a video from the channel [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0bBLvWXBvc) on Youtube and meant only as an introduction to my studies on the component-based framework Angular. You can access the game on Firebase clicking on this link: [TicTacToe](https://rafaelperestictactoe.web.app/)
